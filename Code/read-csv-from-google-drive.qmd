Here's how to read a csv stored in google drive

Create file id to a file that is set to "anyone with the link" on google drive. Here's an example

```{r}
file_id <- "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Brrw82k-M0EvBPgnLCS0-K-NgTAyx4k6/view?usp=sharing"
```

Now get drive info for file

```{r}
my_file <- drive_get(file_id)
```

Now read file

```{r}
df <- read_csv(download_url)
```
