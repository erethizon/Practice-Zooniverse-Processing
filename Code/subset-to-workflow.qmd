## Overview

When we pull the zooniverse classfication file down, it is huge, and always includes every single classification ever done on our project 🙁

This chunk of code helps us to filter to the correct classifcation and workflow version so we get only the data we need.

### Set up

```{r}
rm(list = ls())
library(tidyverse)
library(googledrive)
library(here)
```

### Read file from google drive

See [here](https://googledrive.tidyverse.org/reference/drive_read_string.html) for more details.

### Subset to correct workflow ID and workflow version
